        <br>or join guided tours led by knowledgeable local guides. As they glide through the serene waters, kayakers may spot a <br>
        <br>variety of marine life, including sea birds, rays, and perhaps even playful dolphins swimming nearby. Whether leisurely paddling <br>
        <br>or embarking on a multi-day expedition, kayaking offers a peaceful and eco-friendly way to connect with Lakshadweep's natural wonders.</h3>
